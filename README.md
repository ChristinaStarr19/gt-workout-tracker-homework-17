## Usage 

This Workout tracker is designed to create a new workout and add to an existing workout. Information is sent from the client to MongoDB using Express servers and Mongoose. Organizing your own home workout regimen is easier when the tracker does all the work. It was also designed to meet the criteria for GT Full-stack Flex program homework requirements.

## Credits

This was a solo project completed as homework for the Georgia Tech, FullStack Flex program. However, I recieved insight on how to execute virtuals from my TA, Peter Colella. Fellow collegues like Brian Warner and Gregory Monroe contributed insight towards creating the code.
